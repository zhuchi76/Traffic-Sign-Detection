# Traffic Sign Detection

## Overview
Traffic Sign Detection is a Dockerized application designed to detect and analyze traffic signs. This application utilizes NVIDIA CUDA for GPU acceleration and is built on a Python environment with libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image, and imutils.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- NVIDIA Docker (for GPU support in Docker)

## Installation and Setup
Before running the application, ensure that Docker and NVIDIA Docker are installed on your system. The application is containerized for easy deployment and isolation.

### Building the Docker Image
Run the `build.sh` script to build the Docker image:
```bash
source build.sh
```
This script will create a Docker image named `traffic-sign-detection`.

### Running the Docker Container
To run the application in a Docker container, use the `docker_run.sh` script:
```bash
source docker_run.sh
```
This script will start the Docker container with the necessary configurations and mount the required directories.

### Joining the Running Container
If you need to attach to the running container, use the `docker_join.sh` script:
```bash
source docker_join.sh
```

## Usage
Describe how to use the application, including any necessary commands, input data formats, and output expectations.

## Contributing
Instructions for how other developers can contribute to the project.

## License
Specify the license under which this project is released, if applicable.
